## Agenda

-   Why Git/GitHub?

-   Git Basics

-   Workflow

-   Branches

-   Next Steps

-   Resources

## Why Git/GitHub

We already have tools for tracking changes and collaboration for text-based documents. Why do we need version control solutions like GitHub?

## Why Git/GitHub

-   Changes in one line of code can drastically impact other areas in non-obvious ways.

-   We generally prototype portions of our code without impacting what is already working in production.

-   We want to have a historical record of changes to provide insight for others and our future selves.

-   We need more than one person to be able to work on a document at once.

## Mostly we want to avoid

## Git

![](images/clipboard-766901085.png){fig-align="center" width="207"}

-   Open source software for managing software projects

-   Very low level - Only available through CLI (i.e. Terminal)

-   Tracks changes to files

## GitHub

![](images/clipboard-251232700.png){fig-align="center"}

-   Web-based platform built on top of Git with an easier to use interface, collaboration and issue tracking system, etc.

-   Free service with enterprise-level paid options

-   A single source of truth

## Git Basics

::: {style="font-size: 0.8em;"}
There's a few key concepts that are important for being successful with Git:

Repository

:   A centralized folder/directory where all of your code lives for a given project and is tracked by Git.

Commit

:   A snapshot of all the files in a repository

Pull

:   Pull changes from the server (remote) that are missing locally.

Push

:   Push changes (the commit) that exist locally but not on the server (remote)
:::

## Repo(sitory)

Repos are a folder/directory that is being tracked by Git.

-   I would suggest creating the repo first in GitHub and then cloning it locally.

    -   Cloning makes a local copy of the repo.

-   While you can go from existing project to GitHub, it's more work so I generally don't suggest it.

## Repo - Create

![](images/clipboard-3455376126.png){fig-align="center" width="512"}

I recommend creating private repos to start with as public are generally accessible to...well, the public.

## Repo - Clone

Click on the Code button to copy the repo's URL

## Repo - Create using Version Control

For RStudio users, I recommend creating a new project using Version Control. We only have to do this once per repo (per machine).

# Demo

## Commit

After we make changes to files located in a repo that Git is tracking, we can commit those changes.

-   [A commit is a snapshot of everything in the local repo that has changed since the last commit.]{style="font-size: 0.8em;"}
-   [We want to make commits around logical units of change as they should tell a story of how the files have changed.]{style="font-size: 0.8em;"}
-   [There is no prescribed amount of work or frequency regarding when to commit, but when enough work has been done that it's worth it to capture that snapshot in time.]{style="font-size: 0.8em;"}

## Commit - Changes

## Commit - UI

![](images/clipboard-2219444449.png){fig-align="center" width="700"}

## Commit - Message

![](images/clipboard-785770512.png){fig-align="center" width="357"}

-   First line \<50 characters, followed by a space, then additional details if necessary

-   If you're writing a lot then the commit is too big/infrequent, too verbose, or some of the details should live elsewhere (comments, issues, etc).

## Not all files should be tracked

Sometimes, there are files within a directory that we don't want git to track:

-   Large files

-   Sensitive files

-   R Package related files

## `.gitignore`

::: {style="font-size: 0.8em;"}
When we create a new project in RStudio using version control (in our case GitHub), it automatically creates a `.gitignore` file with a few key files that don't need to be tracked by git.

You add files to git ignore manually or most IDEs will have a UI interface to add them to `.gitignore`

## `.gitignore` example

These files won't be tracked by Git nor will they show up in GitHub

## Pull/Push

People usually say "Push/Pull", but I'm being very specific in ordering it as Pull/Push. We always want to pull before we push.

As a reminder:

Push

:   Pull changes from the server (remote) that are missing locally.

Push

:   Push changes (the commit) that exist locally but not on the server (remote)

## Why Pull before Push?

What happens in the following scenario:

1.  I clone a repo to work on Feature A
2.  I start working on Feature A
3.  Farshad clones the repo to fix Bug B
4.  Farshad is a coding wizard and pushes the fix for Bug B the same day
5.  Two days later I finish Feature A and want to push it to the remote.

## Merge conflict

If Farshad's fix for Bug B changes the code enough that it now conflicts with code of my new feature, if I try to push it to the remote, I will get denied because of conflicts.

-   This means I need to go back, pull the changes from the remote, make sure my code works properly still for Feature A, and then push it to the remote.

-   This doesn't necessarily happen often but it's always a best practice to avoid this by just pulling before pushing.
